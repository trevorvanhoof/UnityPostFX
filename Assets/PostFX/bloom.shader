Multi-layer bloom, it just blends a ton of inputs that are assumed to be
more and more blurry versions of the original image. This is currently all
handled by many different shaders in the PostProcessingStack on our camera,
but perhaps in the future this should be a compute shader that just processes
the screen into 1 mip-chain directly. I don't have the skill to optimize
that to be worthwhile though, so... enjoy these visuals 
if you have performance budget for it?

Parameter description:

uImage0: The original image
uImage1: Downsample uImage to original resolution / 2 (so a quarter of the total size) and blur
uImage2: Downsample uImage1 & repeat, resulting in original resolution / 4
uImage3: Repeat with uImage2, original resolution / 8
uImage4: Repeat with uImage3, original resolution / 16
uImage5: Repeat with uImage4, original resolution / 32
uImage6: Repeat with uImage5, original resolution / 64

All these images [1, 6] are then added together using uBloomWeights
to fade them in and out, based on your style you may want to start out
with all weights = 1, or all weights getting quadratically smaller (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc)
for a tighter bloom (works better at low bloom amounts). 

uLensDirt: Lens dirt texture, we multiply the resulting bloom stack with this texture.
uLensDirtAmount: Fade the amount of lens dirt we apply, 0 means lens dirt texture is ignored.
uBloom: After selecting lens dirt amount, we fade the original image with the result by this amount, 0 means no bloom.
